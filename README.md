# Job Seekers Platform

Registration involves the society platform (registering to the platform and applying for jobs), the company platform (giving jobs, viewing and accepting/rejecting registrations from the society), and the officer platform (updating company data, checking the validity of society data).

This module is only to create a society platform. Your job is creating a Society Job application REST API using one of provided PHP frameworks (Laravel).
